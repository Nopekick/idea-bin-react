# idea-bin-react
Inspired by Aaron's idea bin. Credit goes to him for the idea. 
I was bored so I made it as a React complement to his awesome Vue app. It's similar but not exactly the same. 


Styling is based on how Aaron's app looks, but code was not copied. Cryptography code is from aesjs documentation. 
It has CRD capabilities, without updating. It won't work for you because I took out the database connection.
'node index.js' to start backend and 'npm start' to start frontend. 
Enjoy!
